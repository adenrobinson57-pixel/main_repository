This repository is meant to act as the hub of all of the websites i have published on GitHub. if you are here from the games doc I made, then welcome, it's been a while since I last added to it. If you have games from that doc that you want made into a website, please leave a request there. If you have no idea what that is, it is a copy of the ultimate game stash that I made and have added a little bit to.                                                                                                                                      tuffclient here [https://adenrobinson57-pixel.github.io/tuffclient1.12-2/]                                                                                                            another tuffclient [https://adenrobinson57-pixel.github.io/tuffclient1.12-1/]                                                                                                         eaglercraft 1.12 [placeholder will add later]                                                                                                                                         eaglercraft 1.8 [placeholder will add later]                                                                                                                                          eaglerforge 1.12 [placeholder will add later]                                                                                                                                         eaglerforge 1.8 [placeholder will add later]                                                                                                                                          autoclient indev version [placeholder will add later]                                                                                                                                 controler enabled tuffclient [placeholder will add later]                                                                                                                             my game doc []Sorry for all the placeholders I am just making some formatting.
