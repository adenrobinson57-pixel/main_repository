# main_repository
This repository is meant to act as the hub of all of the websites i have published on GitHub. if you are here from the games doc I made, then welcome, it's been a while since I
last added to it. If you have games from that doc that you want made into a website, please leave a request there. If you have no idea what that is, it is a copy of the game stash
that I made and have added a little bit to.
